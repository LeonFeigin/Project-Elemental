# Project Elemental

## About This Game

A fast-paced bullet hell game where players battle using elemental characters with unique abilities, combining intense dodging mechanics with team-based strategic combat.

This is my final project for grade 11 AP Comp Sci, fully written in Java.

This game was inspired by Touhou's bullet hell and Genshin Impact's Elemental Match Up


## How to play

Run the run.bat file which will auto-compile all of the java files for you. (Assuming you have java installed)

If you are running into errors while compilying, try downloading the pre-compiled version in [latest release](https://github.com/LeonFeigin/Project-Elemental/releases/latest)

By killing other monsters, you can collect various of armor that grants you buffs.

Using elemental match-ups and your newly acquired armor, you can defeat the main boss that is located at the top of the world.

Make sure not to die because your character only lives once!
